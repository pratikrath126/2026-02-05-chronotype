## 🚀 About

ChronoType is a temporal typography editor. It's a creative writing tool that visualizes the rhythm and pace of your typing. The style, weight, and family of the font change in real-time based on your typing speed, creating a unique visual fingerprint of your writing process.

This project was created as part of a daily coding challenge to build unique, interactive web experiences.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Typography:** Text styling changes based on your characters-per-second.
  - **Fast Typing:** Produces a bold, futuristic, high-energy font (`Orbitron`).
  - **Moderate Typing:** Renders a clean, modern sans-serif (`Roboto Mono`).
  - **Slow & Deliberate Typing:** Shifts to an elegant, italicized serif (`Lora`).
- **Pause Detection:** Pausing in your typing introduces a subtle "glitch" or style shift, emphasizing breaks in thought.
- **Real-time Visual Feedback:** See the text transform as you type.
- **Minimalist UI:** A clean, distraction-free interface puts the focus on your writing and its visual representation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3:** Custom properties, transitions, and imported Google Fonts for dynamic styling.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Core logic for tracking typing speed, handling user input, and manipulating the DOM.

No frameworks or external libraries (besides Google Fonts) were used, keeping the project lightweight and focused on core web technologies.

## How It Works

The application listens for `keydown` events in a textarea. It calculates the time difference between consecutive keystrokes to determine the instantaneous typing speed. This speed value is then used to apply a set of CSS rules to the characters being typed, which are rendered as `<span>` elements in a separate `<div>` overlaid on the textarea. A `setTimeout` detects pauses in typing, triggering another style change.
